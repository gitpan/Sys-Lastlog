Sys::Lastlog
============

This module is designed to provided an Object Oriented API to the lastlog
file found on many Unix-like systems.  Some systems do not have this file
so this module will not be of much use on those systems.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module does require that the structure of the lastlog is defined in
the system C header files.  By default it will look for the definition in
utmp.h but some systems (notably Solaris) have a lastlog.h file which
contains the definition - if compilation fails because the C compiler has
been unable to find the definition then redo the install again but with
the first step as:

  perl Makefile.PL DEFINE='-DUSE_LASTLOG_H'

and hopefully then everything will be alright.  If it isnt then please
contact the author with as much information as might determine where
lastlog is defined.
